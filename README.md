# combustion-balancer

The EquationBalancer class reads in a hydrocarbon (e.g. C2H4) and returns the complete combustion reaction for that compound.
Running 
```
$ java EquationBalancer C2H4 
```
will return '1 C2H4 + 3O2 -> 2 CO2 + 2 H2O'

Or, 1 mole of C2H4 (ethylene) reacts with 3 moles of oxygen (O2) to produce 2 moles of carbon dioxide (CO2) and 2 moles of water (H2O).
